The epic calculator, the most useless way to do Math!
</p>

# Current Features:
- Simple Math
- Cool Effects
- A Money System
- Gambling 🤑
- Upgrades (Only 2 rn lol)
- Uncertainty (Only in addition rn, I was too lazy to add it to the rest lol)
- A **secret** command

# Why did I make this?
This is a question you might be asking yourself, and I understand it, who would spend hundreds of lines of code to create a calculator that doesnt even serve its purpose? And I say: *Why not?*

# Notes
The website works on mobile devices, but is not recommended to use it in them.
